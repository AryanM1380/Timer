# Countdown Timer Python Project

This project is a simple countdown timer built using Python. It demonstrates how to use the `time` module and while loops to create a timer that counts down from a user-specified time to zero.

## Getting Started

To run the Countdown Timer Python project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the project as a ZIP file.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. If you don't have Python, you can download and install it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

## How to Use the Countdown Timer

1. Run the Python script `countdown_timer.py` in your terminal or command prompt using the following command:

```bash
python countdown_timer.py
```

2. You will be prompted to enter the countdown time in seconds. Please enter a positive integer to start the timer.

3. The timer will begin the countdown, displaying the remaining time in the format MM:SS (minutes:seconds).

4. Once the countdown reaches zero, the message "Time's up!" will be displayed.

## Example

```
Welcome to the Countdown Timer!
Enter the countdown time in seconds: 10
00:10
00:09
00:08
00:07
00:06
00:05
00:04
00:03
00:02
00:01
00:00
Time's up!
```
